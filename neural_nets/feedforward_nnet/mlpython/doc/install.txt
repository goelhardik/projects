Installation Instructions
=========================

Getting MLPython
----------------

MLPython is developed under Mercurial and is hosted by `bitbucket
<http://bitbucket.org/>`_. To get MLPython, get a `bitbucket <http://bitbucket.org/>`_ account 
and clone MLPython as follows: ::

   hg clone https://bitbucket.org/HugoLarochelle/mlpython

To learn more about Mercurial, see http://mercurial.selenic.com/ (or
for a very quick-and-dirty presentation, see
http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/QuickStart).  Mercurial is available
through its advanced packaging tool on Ubuntu (``sudo apt-get
install mercurial``) or through MacPorts on Mac OS X (``sudo port install
mercurial``).

Required libraries
------------------

MLPython requires a few, fairly standard scientific computing libraries:

* `BLAS <http://netlib.org/blas/>`_: Library for basic vector/matrix linear algebra operations.
* `LAPACK <http://www.netlib.org/lapack/>`_: Library for other linear algebra operations (linear solver, LU decomposition, etc.).
* `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_: Python package for scientific computing with N-dimensional arrays.
* `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_: Python package for 2D plotting.

Installing these libraries on Ubuntu is straightforward, using its advanced packaging tool: ::

   sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev python-dev python-numpy 
   sudo apt-get install python-scipy ipython python-matplotlib

For Mac OS X, the simplest thing to do might be to install Python
using the Mac OS X installer available here:
http://www.python.org/download/ (we recommend Python 2.7 or later).
Other Python libraries can then be installed through easy_install (which
is part of `setuptools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_): ::

   sudo easy_install numpy
   sudo easy_install scipy

You can try using ``easy_install`` to install matplotlib. When these
instructions were written, it did not work for Python 2.7. Instead,
you can obtain the source through `git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ and use the Makefile for Mac OS X: ::
   
   git clone git://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib.git
   cd matplotlib
   mkdir ~/python/devjunk
   sudo make -f make.osx PREFIX=~/python/devjunk PYVERSION=2.7 clean fetch deps mpl_install_std

where ``~/python/devjunk`` is where certain dependencies will be
install (you can change it to some other directory, as long as it exists).

You might want to set macosx as the backend for mathplotlib. This is
done by appending to the ~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc file (which you might
need to create) the line: ::

   backend : macosx

You will also need to add to your ``CPATH`` environment variable the
path to the NumPy C header files. To figure out where they are, you
can import NumPy in python: ::

   >>> import numpy
   >>> numpy
   <module 'numpy' from '/Library/Frameworks/EPD64.framework/Versions/6.3/lib/python2.6/site-packages/numpy/__init__.pyc'>

which will reveal the path of the directory where NumPy is installed
(in this exemple,
/Library/Frameworks/EPD64.framework/Versions/6.3/lib/python2.6/site-packages/numpy/).
Append the subdirectory core/include to that path and add it to
``CPATH`` in ~/.profile: ::

   export CPATH=/Library/Frameworks/EPD64.framework/Versions/6.3/lib/python2.6/site-packages/numpy/core/include:$CPATH



MLPython also interfaces other third-party software that are
not absolutely required to use MLPython. The interfaces
can be found in subdirectories of mlpython/learners/third_party
and mlpython/misc/third_party. Each subdirectory contains a README
file describing how to download and install the required software.

Installing MLPython
-------------------

Your copy of MLPython in hand, you must now do the following steps before 
you can use it:

* You must add the path of the subdirectory containing your copy of
  MLPython in your PYTHONPATH. Say your MLPython is in $HOME/python/mlpython
  and you are using a bash shell, simply add the following line to
  your .bashrc file: ::

   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/python

* MLPython also uses the environment variable MLPYTHON_DATASET_REPO as
  the path where to download machine learning datasets. Simply create
  once a directory at your preferred location ::

   mkdir $HOME/ml_datasets

  and set MLPYTHON_DATASET_REPO to the path of that directory in your 
  shell configuration file: ::
   
   export MLPYTHON_DATASET_REPO=$HOME/ml_datasets

* MLPython contains some C code that needs to be compiled. On Unix systems,
  simply type ``make`` in the root directory of MLPython: ::

   cd $HOME/python/mlpython
   make

* MLPython also comes with scripts that facilitate running certain
  machine learning experiments and consult their results. They are
  located in the subdirectory ``mlpython/scripts/`` and we suggest you
  add the full path to your PATH environment variable.

You should now be able to use MLPython!
