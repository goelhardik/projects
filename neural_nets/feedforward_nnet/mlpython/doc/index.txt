Welcome to MLPython's documentation!
====================================

MLPython is a library for organizing machine learning
research. There are two reasons why you might be interested in MLPython:

1. to rapidly gain access to many datasets and learning algorithms or
2. to organize your own machine learning research into a consistent,
   flexible and simple framework.

I developed MLPython to support my own research. I wanted a system that would
allow me to quickly experiment with new research ideas. Having found it
to deliver well on this account, I decided to share MLPython with others.
I hope you enjoy it!

* :ref:`install`: Details on how to download and install MLPython.
* :ref:`tutorial`: A walk-through over diffrent examples of how to use MLPython.
* :ref:`extend`: Guidelines for contributing to MLPython and extending it.
* :ref:`library`: Detailed documentation, extracted from the source code docstrings.

Here's a quick peek at what MLPython let's you do: ::

   import numpy as np
   import mlpython.datasets.store as dataset_store
   from mlpython.learners.classification import NNet
   from mlpython.learners.features import RBM

   dataset_store.download('mnist')
   trainset,validset,testset = dataset_store.get_classification_problem('mnist')

   nnet = NNet(n_stages=10)
   nnet.train(trainset)

   outputs,costs = nnet.test(testset)
   print 'Classification error on test set is',np.mean(costs,axis=0)[0]

As is probably obvious, this code snippet downloads the MNIST dataset,
trains a feed-forward neural network for 10 iterations on it and
finally computes the average classification error on a test set.
