Extending MLPython
======================

.. contents::

You'd like to contribute new pieces to MLPython? Great! Here are some
guidelines for how to do it (it is assumed that the reader as gone
through the :ref:`tutorial` section).

Implementation Philosophy
-------------------------


First, a few words about the main guiding philosophy behind MLPython.

When I started designing MLPython, I decided that it should not only
be simple to use (dah!) but also be based on a simple implementation.
While this later choice can seem odd and is admittedly due to my limited
Python expertise, it is also motivated by the wish that other
programmers with equal or worse Python programming experience be able
to contribute to it. This is important, since the machine
learning community includes not just computer scientists but also
mathematicians and statisticians with varying programming skills.
Hence, given the vast array of learning algorithms in the literature,
it made sense to focus on an implementation which would require
as little time as possible for someone to start contributing to it.

Moreover, the combined simplicity and expressiveness of Python means
that many aspects of a machine learning framework need not be
implemented by complex class hierarchies. Often, a simple script can
do the job and be much easier to understand. MLPython follows this
intuition by using a (shallow) class hierarchy only for the learning
algorithms and for processed datasets (:ref:`mlproblems`).  The rest
of the framework relies on a set of functions in modules, for instance
to load the raw datasets or perform some desired visualization.

A lot of thought has also been put into the class hierarchies in order
to strip down their complexity, mainly by restricting each class to
only a few methods.  For example, a learning algorithm or
:ref:`Learners` object only requires four methods (plus the
constructor).  The most complicated component of MLPython probably
corresponds to the MLProblems, but even then, MLProblems are really
just iterator objects, with some additional properties (referred to as
metadata).

Finally, MLPython relies a lot on conventions and on duck-typing
("if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck").
The user should focus on making sure that the different objects being
combined behave correctly (e.g. that an MLProblem passed to some
Learner defines all the metadata that this Learner expects), and less
on what types these objects are. Consequently, all code should be well
documented, with docstrings that are explicit about how each object should
be used.

Most contributions to MLPython will probably consist in a new dataset
or a new learning algorithm. Contributions of interfaces to
third-party software are also encouraged. Other contributions, such as
implementations of new MLProblems, are also welcome but will require
deeper knowledge of the MLPython library. 

Datasets
--------

Adding support in MLPython for a new dataset is very simple. First,
you must add a new module to the ``mlpython.datasets`` package, with
the name corresponding to the dataset's name (e.g. module ``mlpython.datasets.mnist`` 
for the MNIST dataset). This new module should provide two functions:


* ``obtain(dir_path)``:                     Downloads the dataset in directory ``dir_path``.
* ``load(dir_path, load_to_memory=False)``:  Returns the data and metadata corresponding to the training, validation and test sets for this dataset at path ``load_to_memory``. The ``load_to_memory`` argument should let the user decide whether the dataset is loaded in memory or is kept on disk.

The ``obtain`` should put the data in a format which will facilitate
loading the dataset (in memory or on disk). The option of not loading
the dataset in memory is important: it will come useful if a dataset
is particularly big or if the data only needs to be transferred to
another device, for instance a GPU. If ``mlpython.datasets`` currently
contains a dataset of similar nature to your new dataset, looking at
its module should give a better idea of how to create the new dataset
module.

The second and final step to adding a new dataset is to add support
for it in the ``mlpython.datasets.store`` module. To do this, simply
add the string name of the dataset module to any of the
``datasets.store.*_names`` variables (which are sets of string)
corresponding to appropriate machine learning problems for your new
dataset. For instance, string ``'mnist'`` is found in
``datasets.store.classification_names``. You might want to take a look
at the associated ``datasets.store.get_*_problem`` function that loads
the dataset's data and metadata to create the MLProblems, so as to see
which MLProblem will be created and what is expected from the data and
metadata returned by the dataset's ``load`` function (e.g. what
keywords should the metadata have).

MLProblems
----------

In a nutshell, an MLProblem object is an iterator object with a length and two 
simple but important methods:

* ``setup(self)``:  This method is usually called at the end of the construction the object. It adapts the MLProblem's internal state based on the data it contains, if needed.
* ``apply_on(self, new_data, new_metadata={})``:  Returns an MLProblem that contains the new data and metadata, but that is "compatible" with the given MLProblem.

As described in the :ref:`tutorial` section, an MLProblem is
constructed from a source of data and some optional metadata
dictionary. The only thing that can be assumed about the source data
is that it is possible to iterate over it (i.e. it has a
``__iter__()`` method that outputs an iterator). In other words, you
should not access its content by indexation or any other way than
iterating.

When constructing a new MLProblem, it is recommended to start from the following skeleton: ::

   import copy
   from mlpython.mlproblems.generic import MLProblem
   
   class MyProblem(MLProblem):
       """
       ONE LINE DESCRIPTION
       
       MULTILINE DESCRIPTION, WITH OPTION DESCRIPTIONS
   
       """
   
       def __init__(self, data=None, metadata={},call_setup=True):  # Add other arguments if needed

           # Always call the superclass's constructor (here MLProblem)
           MLProblem.__init__(self,data,metadata)
   
           # Set the object's constructor option based on the
           # constructors arguments other than data, metadata and
           # call_setup (those are dealt with by the superclass).
           
	   # PUT CODE HERE
   
           # Call setup *at the end* of the constructor, if call_setup is True
           if call_setup: MyProblem.setup(self)
   
       def setup(self):
           # Set the internal state of the MLProblem, based on its source data.
           # This could require the setting of object fields or the assignment
           # of new metadata.
	   
           # PUT CODE HERE, OTHERWISE PASS
	   pass
   
       def __iter__(self):
           # Iterate over source data and yield each example with appropriate processing
	   for example in self.data:
              # IF CHANGING example, USE A DEEPCOPY
	      new_example = copy.deepcopy(example)

              # PUT CODE HERE (DO SOMETHING TO new_example)

              yield new_example

       def __len__(self):
           # Outputs the number of examples in the dataset

           # IMPLEMENT ONLY IF THE LENGTH OF DIFFERENT FROM
           # THE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS ITERATED OVER BY self.data,
           # OTHERWISE SIMPLY INHERIT FROM PARENT CLASS OR
           return MLProblem.__len__(self)


       def apply_on(self, new_data, new_metadata={}):
           # Always check whether the source data is itself an MLProblem,
           # so as to recursively call apply_on on it too
           if self.__source_mlproblem__ is not None:
               new_data = self.__source_mlproblem__.apply_on(new_data,new_metadata)
               new_metadata = {}   # new_data should already contain the new_metadata, since it is an mlproblem
   
           # Construct new MLProblem of the same class, with call_setup =
           # False since we want to use the same internal state
           new_problem = MyProblem(new_data,new_metadata,call_setup=False) # Pass same other constructor arguments
   
           # Copy internal state information to the new MLProblem

           # PUT CODE HERE
   
           return new_problem

In most cases, you'll only have to replace the ``PUT CODE HERE``
comments by appropriate code implementing the desired behavior. The
rest of the code already present in the methods of the above template
should also be present. Its main purpose is to correctly support the
composition of MLProblems one into another. Also, method ``__len__()`` 
should only be defined if it should output something different than
``len(self.data)``.

To better illustrate how MLProblem objects are implemented, let's
consider an example. Imagine that you wish to write an MLProblem that
takes some data and centers it, i.e. removes the mean of each
input. Let's call that object CenteredProblem. However, the value of
the means to subtract is not known a priori and depends on the
data. In this case, the role of ``setup()`` would be to compute the
means of the each input and save the information within the object.

Now, assume you have centered your training set, and now wish to apply
exactly the same processing to some new data (for instance the test
set). This is when you call ``apply_on()``. Its role will be to take
the new data, create a new CenteredProblem object containing that data and
setting the internal state of this new object such that it subtracts
the *same* means.

More specifically, here is what CenteredProblem's implementation would look like: ::

   import copy
   from mlpython.mlproblems.generic import MLProblem

   class CenteredProblem(MLProblem):
       """
       Centers the input of a dataset.
       
       Option ``input_index`` is the value of the index corresponding to
       the input, for each example. If ``None``, then the example itself
       is the input.
   
       """
   
       def __init__(self, data=None, metadata={},call_setup=True,input_index=None):
           # Always call the superclass's constructor (here MLProblem)
           MLProblem.__init__(self,data,metadata)
   
           # Set the object's constructor option based on the
           # constructors arguments other than data, metadata and
           # call_setup (those are dealt with by the superclass).
           self.input_index = input_index
   
           # Call setup *at the end* of the constructor, if call_setup is True
           if call_setup: CenteredProblem.setup(self)
   
       def setup(self):
           # Set the internal state of the MLProblem, based on its source data.

           # Compute average of the inputs
           first_example = True
           for example in self.data:
               if first_example:
                   # Use first example to initialize the average
                   first_example = False
                   if self.input_index is None:
                       self.center = copy.deepcopy(example)
                   else:
                       self.center = copy.deepcopy(example[self.input_index])
               else:
                   if self.input_index is None:
                       self.center += example
                   else:
                       self.center += example[self.input_index]
           self.center /= len(self.data)
   
       def __iter__(self):
           # Iterate over source data and yield copy of example with centered input
           for example in self.data:
               centered_example = copy.deepcopy(example)
               if self.input_index is None:
                   centered_example -= self.center
               else:
                   centered_example[self.input_index] -= self.center
               yield centered_example
   
       def apply_on(self, new_data, new_metadata={}):
           # Always check whether the source data is itself an MLProblem,
           # so as to recursively call apply_on on it too
           if self.__source_mlproblem__ is not None:
               new_data = self.__source_mlproblem__.apply_on(new_data,new_metadata)
               new_metadata = {}   # new_data should already contain the new_metadata, since it is an mlproblem
   
           # Construct new MLProblem of the same class, with call_setup =
           # False since we want to use the same internal state
           new_problem = CenteredProblem(new_data,new_metadata,call_setup=False,input_index=self.input_index)
   
           # Copy internal state information to the new MLProblem
           new_problem.center = copy.deepcopy(self.center)
   
           return new_problem
 
Another interesting example is the ClassSubsetProblem, for which
`setup()` and `apply_on` must deal with the correct assignment of
metadata. It is recommended to take a look at the source code
(see :ref:`mlproblems_classification`).

Finally, here are a few guidelines to follow when implementing a new MLProblem:

* When implementing the ``__iter__()`` method, be careful not to modify the content of the source
  data. Either yield a modified (deep) copy of the example, or yield the example itself
  if it isn't modified. Also, each yielded example should be a distinct object. For instance, do
  not return a pointer to a unique object whose content is changed while iterating.
* It is a good idea to make your MLProblem compatible with as many types of examples as possible. 
  A fairly general assumption is that examples are going to be either a single (for instance an input
  without a target) or a tuple/list of (for instance an input and its target) elements. These
  elements could be a various nature (NumPy arrays of arbitrary dimension, integers, strings, etc.).
  All such assumptions should be clearly commented in the class's docstring (see :ref:`documenting_code`)
* The requirement that ``apply_on()`` output the same type of MLProblem is not a strict one. There are
  cases where it's actually not what you want to do. An example is the SemisupervisedProblem (see :ref:`mlproblems_generic`)
  which removes labels of a subset of the example. This is probably not what you want to do on new data,
  like the test set, hence this object's ``apply_on()`` either returns a basic MLProblem or an MLProblem
  of the same type as the source data (see :ref:`mlproblems_generic` for the source code).

Learners
--------

As mentioned in the :ref:`tutorial` section, Learner objects should
define the four following methods, in addition to the constructor:

* ``train(self,trainset)``: runs the learning algorithm on ``trainset`` (it returns nothing).
* ``forget(self)``: resets the Learner to it's original state (also return nothing).
* ``use(self,dataset)``: computes and returns the output of the Learner for ``dataset``. 
  The method should return an iterator over these outputs.
* ``test(self,dataset)``: computes and returns the outputs of the Learner as well as the cost of 
  those outputs for ``dataset``. The method should return a pair of two iterators, the first
  being over the outputs and the second over the costs.

As for the constructor, it should be used to set the different
hyper-parameters of the Learner. Of course, do not forget to inherit from Learner.

And that's it! Obviously, one is free to implement other methods, but
as far as MLPython is concerned, a Learner only need to be trainable,
usable and testable, and it should be possible to have it forget its
learned state so as to retrain from scratch.

That being said, in addition to implementing these methods, it is as
important to clearly and thoroughly document the code. Particular care
is required in documenting the object's documentation through its
docstring. It will specify things like the meaning of the options or
hyper-parameters of the Learner and the metadata required in the
MLProblems that can be fed to the Learner. See :ref:`documenting_code`
for more on this crucial aspect.

Contributions of interfaces to third-party software is also encouraged.
All such code should be incorporated as a separate subpackage the within
``mlpython.learners.third_party`` package. The associated directory
should also contain a README file with instructions on how to download
and install the necessary software. Finally, please mention this
dependency in the :ref:`install` section.

Common metadata keywords
------------------------

Though the characterization of the metadata in an MLProblem does not
need to follow any particular rules, there are already several
keywords that are being commonly defined and used within the
MLProblems and Learners in MLProblem right now. Hence, before
inventing a new metadata keyword, it is highly recommended to first
make sure that an equivalent keyword is not already in use.  Adopting
such keywords will then increase the compatibility of your code with
that of other components already present in MLPython.

Here is a list of keywords you should consider using:

* ``'input_size'``: Size of the input.
* ``'target_size'``: Size of the target, (for instance for multilabel or multiregression).
* ``'length'``: Number of examples in a dataset. Not always necessary, but is useful for large
  datasets for which the length would be too long to compute.
* ``'targets'``: A Set of all possible targets (in string format).
* ``'class_to_id'``: Dictionary mapping a string class label to an index (from 0 to number of classes).
* ``'n_queries'``: Number of queries (ranking problem). Similarly to ``length``, it is optional 
  and will set the output of ``__len__(self)`` in RankingProblem.
* ``'scores'``: List of possible scores, ordered from less relevant to more relevant (ranking problem).
* ``'n_pairs'``: Number of document/query pairs (ranking problem). Same as ``n_queries``, but for RankingToClassificationProblem.

If you contribution code to MLPython that uses a different keyword,
please add it to this list, as well as to the text file
mlpython/metadata_keywords.txt.

Mathutils
---------

While Python is a very flexible language, it can be painfully slow for
certain operations. In such cases, implementing a C function and
embedding it into Python is a much better approach. The
``mlpython.mathutils`` contains such functions, for several common 
mathematical operations in machine learning. It currently has
two modules:

* ``mlpython.mathutils.linalg``: Linear algebra operations, such as matrix products, linear solver, etc.
* ``mlpython.mathutils.nonlinear``: Nonlinear operations, including the sigmoid function and its derivative.

These modules correspond to Python code that define the different
module functions, where each function calls its associated core C
implementation. The idea is that the Python code should do things like
testing conditions on the arguments of the function, and the core C
function should do the rest of the work. 

To add functions to the modules or even add new modules, it is
recommended to follow the same Python/C coding approach. However, you
are free to use any C binding tool for embedding the C code into
Python. Instead of implementing complete C extensions as currently
does ``mlpython.mathutils.linalg`` and
``mlpython.mathutils.nonlinear`` (see
http://www.scipy.org/Cookbook/C_Extensions/NumPy_arrays for more
details on this), one could instead implement regular C functions and
use `ctypes <http://docs.python.org/library/ctypes.html>`_ to access
them. Finally, make sure that calling the Makefile will compile the
new C code.

.. _documenting_code:

Documenting your code
-----------------------

Whether you are adding a new module, object or function in MLPython,
it is primordial that you provide good documentation for it. In
particular, any such code should come with a clear and thorough
docstring (see
http://packages.python.org/an_example_pypi_project/sphinx.html#full-code-example
for example of code with docstrings). 

One reason why this is important is that the :ref:`library` is
actually automatically generated from these docstrings. It is
generated using `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_, which itself
uses `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ as
its markup language (see
http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html for a
quick overview of reStructuredText).

The other reason why writing good docstrings is important is that this
is where users will find information for how to use your code.  In
most cases, contributions will consist in a new dataset module, or a
new Learner/MLProblem class. The docstring should then specify what
options/hyper-parameters must be provided, what metadata is required
by the object and what metadata is defined (for dataset modules and
MLProblem classes only). If appropriate, references to papers or
websites can also be given in the docstring. 

Here is a short template of what a class docstring should look like: ::

   class MyNewClass(MyParentClass):
      """
      Short description of MyNewClass

      Longer description of MyNewClass
   
      **Options:**

      * ``hyper_param_1``:       Description of first hyper-parameter.
      * ``hyper_param_2``:       Description of second hyper-parameter.
   
      **Required metadata:**

      * ``'metadata_in'``:        Description of metadata (optional, perhaps only if unsual metadata)
   
      **Defined metadata:**

      * ``'metadata_out'``:       Description of metadata defined/added by object (for MLProblems)
   
      | **Reference:** 
      | Name of paper or website
      | List of paper/website authors (last name only
      | URL to paper/website

      """

Whether you are considering contribution a package, module, class or
function, it is recommended to look at the docstring of other such
structures already in MLPython first, to get a few examples of what
docstrings should contain. These docstring always follow the
reStructuredText markup language. 

A common style convention followed by all docstrings is that, When
designating a package, module, function, variable or a one-line Python
expression, put its name between pairs of \`\`backward single
quotes\`\`. For example, \`\`mlpython.learners.generic\`\` will show
up as ``mlpython.learners.generic``. However, when referring to a
class name, quotes don't need to be use.
